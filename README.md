# SCT_DS_4

📌 Project Overview

This project is part of my Data Science internship. The objective was to analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day and visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

📂 Dataset

Source: Publicly available road accident datasets 

Description: The dataset contains information on accidents, including location, time, road type, weather conditions, number of vehicles involved, and casualties.

⚙️ Steps Performed

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values and duplicates

Standardized time and location formats

Encoded categorical variables

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed accident occurrences by road type, weather conditions, and time of day

Studied correlation between accident severity and contributing factors

Data Visualization

Created heatmaps for accident hotspots

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium (for maps)
Scikit-learn (optional, for analysis)

🚀 Learnings

Practical experience in data cleaning, EDA, and visualization
Understanding patterns in real-world datasets
